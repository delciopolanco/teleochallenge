Which ones would you address in an initial v0 release, and which ones might you
include in later iterations?

If I understood your question, what approach i would implement in an initial v0 release?

1 - If I don't have the too much budget to implement a third party service I would go with an MVP of htmltocanvas + firebase, since this is a convenience way to create images based on a entire screen with out having to do too much logic, and I would store the images as blob in firebase which provides a decent api and will allows us to implement this feature in a considerable amount of time.
