# teleochallenge

Part 1 [~30 minutes]
A.
How would you technically implement generating a screenshot image of a part of the screen in
the Teleo app? Please identify 2-3 different approaches you could take (such as different
libraries or APIs to use), describe the pros and cons of each, and provide a recommendation.
(No need to actually write any code.)

B.
Once you have generated the screenshots, where/how would you store them? Again, no need
to actually implement this, just describe your approach and rationale.
Part 2 [ ~90 minutes]

Implement a React component that is a list of all of the screenshots saved for a particular kid,
including a thumbnail for each screenshot.
For the purposes of this task, please mock/stub out any data requests to backend services with
sample data so that you can actually render an example of the component.

If you are familiar with GraphQL, please write any GraphQL queries you would use. Otherwise,
please write any PostgreSQL queries that would be used.
Please also respond to the following questions: Which edge cases should you consider with this
component? Which ones would you address in an initial v0 release, and which ones might you
include in later iterations?

If you have time, please cover any v0 edge cases in your code.
Submission

Please submit the following to julia@teleo.space within 2 hours of opening this task description:
● your responses
● your code
● a screenshot of your rendered component

Because of email attachment restrictions, it may be easiest to create a private GitHub repository
with your responses and invite julia@teleo.space as a collaborator, or send a ZIP file via email
or a file sharing service. Thank you!
